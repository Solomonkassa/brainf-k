# Brainfuck README

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language with a minimalist syntax and a limited set of commands. Created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, it is known for its difficulty in programming and its educational and entertainment value.

## Commands

Brainfuck has only 8 commands, each represented by a single character:

1. `>` increment the data pointer (move the pointer to the right)
2. `<` decrement the data pointer (move the pointer to the left)
3. `+` increment the byte at the data pointer
4. `-` decrement the byte at the data pointer
5. `.` output the byte at the data pointer
6. `,` accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer
7. `[` if the byte at the data pointer is zero, jump forward to the matching ]
8. `]` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, jump backward to the matching [

## Examples

Here is an example of a Hello World program in Brainfuck:

++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.


This program increments and decrements cells in the data tape, outputting ASCII characters to produce the message "Hello World!".

## Interpreters

To run a Brainfuck program, you will need an interpreter. Many Brainfuck interpreters are available online or as standalone programs.

## Usage

Brainfuck is mainly used for educational and entertainment purposes, but can also be used to solve some programming challenges. Due to its limited set of commands, it can be challenging to write complex programs in this language.
